Hi there 👋 my name is Mark!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code in Javascript language and how GitHub works, this is all new for me :D
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on music projects and also trading projects. Maybe in the future I can collab in other stuff like videogames...
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with code languages, Git, and how all the community of GitHub works
- 💬 Ask me about action sports, music projects, electronic hardware PCB's, siemens PLC's and all that similar stuff... I also can do translations in german or spanish.
